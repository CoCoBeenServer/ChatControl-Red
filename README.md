ChatControl Red™ is the next generation chat-management Minecraft plugin, replacing ChatControl Pro.

We're offering free upgrades to selected users of ChatControl Pro, please see this page:

Please note — We will continue updating ChatControl Pro for the time being, fixing major bugs and updating it to work with future MC versions. However, it's strongly recommended to upgrade since ChatControl Red™ is a total rewrite bringing over 100 of requested features, and bug fixes.
